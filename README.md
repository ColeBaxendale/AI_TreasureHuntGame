## Deep Q-Learning Based Treasure Hunt Game

## Overview
This project implements a Deep Q-Learning algorithm in a simulated treasure hunt environment where an AI agent (the pirate) is trained to navigate through a maze to find a treasure. The primary goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Deep Q-Learning in training agents to perform in environments with defined states, actions, and rewards.
